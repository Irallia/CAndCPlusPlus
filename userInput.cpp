    /*
        Assuming you typed: 5<enter>John<enter>. Then cin >> age reads JUST 5. leaving the new-line (enter) character on the stream.
        Thus when you try and read the name with getline(cin,name) it reads to the end of line.
        BUT NOTE there is a new-line character just there ready to be read (thus names will be empty (because you did not read off the new-line character after the 5).
        If you want to switch between >> and getline() you need to be carefull about trailing end of lines on your input. â€“ Martin York Apr 21 '11 at 8:41
